# CitOmni

**Low overhead. High performance. Ready for anything.**

CitOmni is a modular PHP framework (PHP 8.2+) designed for ultra-fast execution, zero overhead, and no surprises.
It is built around small Composer packages - HTTP, CLI, Kernel, Infrastructure, Auth, Testing, and more - so you only install what you need.

## Why CitOmni?

* üöÄ **Deterministic boot** - predictable "last wins" config merges (vendor -> providers -> app).
* üß© **Composable design** - slim packages you can combine freely.
* üõ°Ô∏è **Transparent, no magic** - no reflection, no hidden scanning, just clean PSR-4.
* üõ†Ô∏è **Developer-friendly** - deep read-only config, instant service maps, cache-ready.
* ‚ôªÔ∏è **Green by design** - lower memory use and CPU cycles -> less server load, more requests per watt, better scalability, smaller carbon footprint.

### Green by design

CitOmni's "Green by design" claim is empirically validated at the framework level.

The core runtime achieves near-floor CPU and memory costs per request on commodity shared infrastructure, sustaining hundreds of RPS per worker with extremely low footprint.

## Philosophy

CitOmni is built around three principles:

1. **Low overhead** - no bloat, no wasted CPU, memory, or I/O.
2. **High performance** - predictable runtime, cache-friendly design, production-ready.
3. **Ready for anything** - build webapps, APIs, intranet tools, or CLI automation without fighting the framework.

### Sustainable by Design

Software efficiency is not only a matter of speed - it is a matter of sustainability. Every instruction executed and every byte allocated ultimately consumes electricity. When frameworks impose unnecessary overhead, the cost is multiplied at scale: thousands of servers, millions of requests, gigawatts of energy. This translates directly into higher operational costs and a measurable environmental impact.

CitOmni is deliberately engineered to minimize waste:

1. **Deterministic execution paths** - predictable config merges and no runtime scanning mean the CPU is doing only what is strictly required.
2. **Memory-lean architecture** - services and configuration are resolved via static maps, not reflection or discovery mechanisms, keeping allocations minimal.
3. **Cache-friendly design** - compiled arrays and preloaded maps make full use of OPcache and modern CPU caches, reducing redundant parsing and lookups.
4. **Side-effect-free boot** - the framework loads only what you ask for; no hidden I/O, no implicit background tasks.

From a sustainability perspective, this has profound implications:

* **More work per watt**: by reducing framework overhead, each server can handle more requests per unit of energy consumed.
* **Higher server density**: applications can be consolidated on fewer machines without compromising performance, directly lowering hardware demand and embodied emissions.
* **Lower cooling requirements**: efficient CPU and memory usage reduces thermal load, decreasing the energy footprint of data centers.
* **Scalable environmental benefit**: what saves a few milliseconds and kilobytes in a local test translates into massive resource savings when multiplied across global deployments.

The philosophy is simple but rigorous: **an efficient framework does not merely serve developers - it serves the planet.** In a world where digital infrastructure accounts for a growing share of global energy use, CitOmni's focus on low overhead is both a performance strategy and an ecological commitment.

> ### Research note: why software efficiency matters (and scales)
>
> * **Baseline today.** Best-available estimates put data centres at roughly **1-1.3% of global electricity demand (2022)** (IEA, 2022 [1]), excluding crypto. Ranges vary due to methodology and scope.  
> * **Growth outlook.** Multiple analyses project **electricity use more than doubling by ~2030** (‚âà945 TWh in one IEA scenario) with AI a key driver of load growth (IEA, 2024 [2]). Even if the overall share remains a few percent, the absolute TWh rise is significant.  
> * **Methodological caution.** Literature reviews show **wide spreads** in model outputs (from ~200 TWh to >1,000 TWh for 2022), explained by different boundary choices (what counts as "in" the data centre), extrapolation methods, and assumptions. This underlines the value of focusing on *verifiable efficiency at the software/runtime layer* (IEA 4E, 2025 [3]).  
> * **Embodied vs operational.** The footprint isn't only electricity for workloads. **Embodied emissions** from **hardware manufacturing and refresh cycles** (servers, accelerators, storage) are a material part of tech companies' total footprints; reducing server counts and extending lifetimes via efficient software cuts both operational and embodied carbon (Meta, 2024 [4]).  
> * **Why framework overhead matters.** At scale, **milliseconds per request** and **unnecessary allocations/I/O** aggregate into **MWh and hardware demand**. Deterministic boot paths, cache-friendly maps, and avoiding runtime scanning/reflection lower CPU cycles and memory pressure - yielding **more work per watt**, **higher app density per server**, **lower cooling load**, and **fewer machines procured over time**. These micro-efficiencies compound across fleets. Historical data show efficiency as the lever that kept data-centre energy flat amid demand growth (Masanet et al., 2020 [5]).  
>
> **Bottom line:** Even as absolute data-centre electricity use rises, *software-level efficiency* remains a first-order lever. By minimizing overhead in the framework itself, CitOmni converts engineering choices directly into **fewer joules per request**, **fewer servers per workload**, and **lower embodied and operational emissions** - benefits that scale with traffic.
