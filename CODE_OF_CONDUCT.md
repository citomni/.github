# CitOmni Code of Conduct

CitOmni is a community of professionals who value respectful collaboration, technical rigor, and clear communication. We expect all participants to help create a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment across all CitOmni spaces (GitHub issues/PRs, discussions, events, and private maintainer channels related to the project).

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Using inclusive and professional language
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive feedback gracefully
- Focusing on what is best for the project and its users
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments
- Trolling, sustained disruption, or personal attacks
- Public or private harassment, doxxing, or sharing others' private information
- Publishing others' work as your own
- Any conduct that violates applicable law

## Scope

This Code applies within all CitOmni project spaces and when an individual is officially representing the project or its community. **Organization-wide enforcement:** serious or repeated violations in one repository may, at maintainers' discretion, lead to restrictions across other repositories in the CitOmni organization.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. They may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:
- Prefer email: **support@citomni.com**
- Security issues: **security@citomni.com** (see `SECURITY.md` for PGP)

Reports will be reviewed promptly and confidentially. Retaliation against reporters is prohibited.

## Consequences

Actions may include: a warning, content moderation, temporary or permanent bans from project spaces, or escalation to platform support and/or authorities where required.

## Attribution

This policy is informed by widely used open-source codes of conduct. We adapted it to match CitOmni's organization-wide enforcement and security reporting practices.
