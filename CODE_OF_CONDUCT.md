# CitOmni Code of Conduct

We want CitOmni to be welcoming, professional, and productive for everyone.

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Being respectful, considerate, and constructive
- Giving and gracefully accepting feedback
- Focusing on what is best for users and the community
- Showing empathy to other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments
- Trolling, sustained disruption, or inflammatory remarks
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome sexual attention
- Any behavior that violates laws or reasonable professional norms

## Scope
This Code applies within project spaces (issues, PRs, discussions, release notes, docs, chats) and when representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Project maintainers may take appropriate action for behavior they deem inappropriate, including warnings, temporary/permanent bans, or locking threads to maintain a constructive environment.

## Reporting
If you observe or experience unacceptable behavior:
- Email **conduct@citomni.com** (private), or
- Use the private contact listed in a repository's README (for private/proprietary repos)

Please include links, screenshots, and a clear description. We aim to acknowledge within **72 hours**.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.

## Enforcement Guidelines
To ensure consistent and fair handling, maintainers may apply the following, depending on severity and history:

1) **Correction** - A private, specific explanation of the issue and how to avoid it going forward.
2) **Warning** - A formal warning; further violations may lead to temporary or permanent restrictions.
3) **Temporary Ban** - Temporary restriction from participation in project spaces and/or repositories.
4) **Permanent Ban** - Permanent restriction from participation in project spaces and/or repositories.

Maintainers decide appropriate actions at their discretion to preserve a safe, productive environment.

## Appeals & Privacy
If you believe an action was taken in error, you may request a review by replying to **conduct@citomni.com**. We will handle reports confidentially, sharing details only with those who need them to investigate and act.

## Anti-Retaliation
We do not tolerate retaliation against anyone who reports a concern in good faith or participates in an investigation.

## Emergencies
If anyone is in immediate danger, contact local authorities first. You can still notify us at **conduct@citomni.com** once the situation is safe.
