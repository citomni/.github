# CitOmni Trademarks and Brand Usage

"CitOmni" and the CitOmni logo are trademarks of **Lars Grove Mortensen**.  
Trademark rights are **separate from copyright** and are not granted by open-source
licenses (e.g., MIT or Creative Commons).

This document **supplements** the per-repository NOTICE files and governs all use
of CitOmni trademarks, logos, and related identifiers.

## 1) Nominative Fair Use (Descriptive References)

You may refer to **"CitOmni"** to describe **factual compatibility, comparison, or education** -
including in commercial contexts - provided that:

- The use is purely **descriptive** and **does not suggest sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation**.
- You **do not modify** the CitOmni logo or combine it with your own marks.
- You **do not present** your product, service, or publication as **"official", "certified", "endorsed", or "approved"**
  by the CitOmni project unless such status has been **formally granted in writing**.

**Acceptable examples:**
- "Compatible with the CitOmni Framework."
- "Unofficial guide for CitOmni developers."
- "Built for applications using the CitOmni HTTP Kernel."

---

## 2) Prohibited Without Prior Permission

You **may not**, without prior written permission:

- Register or use **"citomni" (or any confusingly similar term)** in:
  - **company names**
  - **domain names**
  - **social handles**
  - **top-level vendor/package names** (e.g., Packagist/GitHub vendor)
- Use the CitOmni logo or word mark in a way that implies official status.
- Market or distribute products, services, or merchandise **under** the CitOmni name.
- Modify, stylize, recolor, or merge the CitOmni logo with other marks.
- Apply for your **own trademark** containing "CitOmni".

If unsure whether your intended use requires permission, contact: **trademarks@citomni.com**.

## 3) Naming Guidelines for Compatible Software

Use names that indicate compatibility **without implying affiliation**.

**Recommended (no permission required):**
- `your-vendor/foo-for-citomni`
- `your-vendor/foo-citomni-adapter`

**Not allowed without permission:**
- `your-vendor/citomni-foo` (names starting with "citomni" can imply official status)
- Any **top-level** vendor or package name that begins with or is "citomni"

> Note: Official packages live under the `citomni/` organization/vendor. Community packages
> should not resemble core names such as `citomni/kernel`, `citomni/http`, `citomni/cli`,
> `citomni/infrastructure`, or any `citomni/*-skeleton`.

---

## 4) Logo Usage

- Use only the **current, unmodified** CitOmni logo files as provided by the project.
- The logo may be shown **only** to refer to CitOmni itself (e.g., in documentation or slides).
- Do **not** use the logo as the primary brand of your product or site, and do not alter colors,
  proportions, or combine it with other brand elements.

Required attribution when showing the logo:
> "CitOmni and the CitOmni logo are trademarks of Lars Grove Mortensen."

---

## 5) Relationship to Open-Source Licenses

Trademark rights are distinct from copyright licenses.

- **MIT** (for framework code) and **CC BY-SA 4.0** (for documentation) grant rights to use, copy,
  modify, and distribute the **content**, but **not** the trademarks.
- Using the CitOmni name or logo for your own brand, product, service, or package/vendor naming
  still requires **prior written permission** where stated above.

---

## 6) Permission Requests & Misuse

- Permission requests: **trademarks@citomni.com**  
  (Include who you are, intended use, where/how it will appear, and mockups if available.)
- Suspected misuse or impersonation: **security@citomni.com**

---

## 7) Changes & Precedence

This policy may evolve. The latest version lives in the `citomni/.github` repository.
In case of any discrepancy, this policy and the applicable NOTICE in the target repository
govern trademark usage; open-source license texts continue to govern copyright.
