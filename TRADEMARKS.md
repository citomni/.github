# CitOmni Trademarks Policy

"**CitOmni**", the CitOmni **name**, and the CitOmni **logo** (the "Marks") are trademarks of **Lars Grove Mortensen**.
This policy explains permissible use of the Marks. It **does not** substitute or limit applicable trademark law.

> **License vs. trademark:** CitOmni code is open source (see each repo's `LICENSE`), but **trademark rights are separate**. Open-source licenses grant copyright permissions, **not** trademark permissions.

---

## Allowed use (no prior approval)

You **may**:

1. **Descriptive references**
   Use "CitOmni" **to refer to the project** in accurate, factual statements:

   * "Compatible with CitOmni"
   * "Built for CitOmni apps"
   * "Plugin for the CitOmni HTTP runtime"

2. **Attribution**
   Credit CitOmni in docs, READMEs, slides, or articles.

3. **Package titles (independent vendors)**
   Use names that clearly indicate compatibility **without implying affiliation**. Prefer:

   * `your-vendor/citomni-foo` (if the repo/README clearly says "Unofficial. Not affiliated."), or
   * `your-vendor/foo-for-citomni` (recommended)
     Avoid names that look like **official** CitOmni packages (see "Prohibited" below).

4. **Screenshots/UI snippets**
   You can show CitOmni screenshots/logos **as part of a truthful reference** (e.g., in blog posts, reviews). Don't alter the logo or make it the focal brand of your product.

---

## Prohibited use (needs explicit permission or is not allowed)

You **must not**:

1. **Imply endorsement or affiliation**
   Don't present your organization, product, or service as **official**, "partnered with," "approved by," or "endorsed by" CitOmni **without written permission**.

2. **Use confusing names or domains**

   * Don't name your product/package `citomni/<anything>` unless it is an **official CitOmni org repo**.
   * Don't register domains that could confuse users about official status (e.g., `citomni-official.com`).
   * Don't use "CitOmni" **as the first/sole brand** for an independent product.

3. **Modify the Marks**
   Don't change the logo, colors, aspect ratio, or combine the logo with other marks.

4. **Merchandise**
   Don't place the CitOmni marks on merchandise (stickers, shirts, mugs, etc.) for sale **without permission**.

5. **Use the Marks as part of your company/organization name**
   Do not form an entity named "CitOmni <Something>" unless you are the rights holder or have written permission.

## Naming guidelines (packages & repos)

* **Official packages** live under the `citomni/` GitHub org and Packagist vendor.
* **Community packages** should avoid implying official status. Prefer:

  * **Recommended:** `your-vendor/foo-for-citomni`, `your-vendor/foo-citomni-adapter`.
  * **If using "citomni" in the artifact name** (e.g., `your-vendor/citomni-foo`), include a prominent note in README:

    > "This is an **unofficial** package, not affiliated with or endorsed by CitOmni."
* Avoid names that look like core packages: `citomni/kernel`, `citomni/http`, `citomni/cli`, `citomni/infrastructure`, `citomni/*-skeleton`, etc.

---

## Logo usage

* Use only the **current, unmodified** logo files as provided by CitOmni (no recoloring, stretching, or adding effects).
* Maintain clear space and legibility; don't place the logo on visually noisy backgrounds.
* Do not use the logo as the **primary brand** of your product or service.

(If you need vector assets or specific usage guidance, contact us.)

## Examples

**OK**

* "`my-cache-adapter-for-citomni` - a cache adapter for CitOmni apps."
* Blog post titled "How we deploy CitOmni on shared hosting" with screenshots and proper credit.
* "Compatible with CitOmni (unofficial)."

**Not OK**

* "CitOmni Pro Router" (implies official status)
* `citomni-cache` repo under your personal/org account (without an "unofficial" disclaimer)
* Modifying the logo colors and using it as your app icon
